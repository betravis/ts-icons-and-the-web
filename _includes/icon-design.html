        * Let's start out by laying some groundwork, what exactly is an icon?

            * Let's start with a working definition.
            * Icons are visual representations of an idea, that help users navigate a graphical interface.
            * Paraphrasing the parts I like from Wikipedia
            * If we go back to the first slide, these cursors help the user maintain the map between their physical mouse location and their virtual screen location.
            * A kind of "you are here" idea.
            * Think of them as signposts.

            * Icons are everywhere these days
            * Smaller screens, packing more information
            * One helpful way to sort all of that is to pack it into pictures, often paired with text
            * We can also see how varied their use can be. On the right, we have icons to help navigate options while performing a specific task.
            * On the left, we have icons to provide branding and differentiate between entirely different tasks.
            * We see icons on the top to indicate signal strength, wifi, battery power.
            * Icons work best when they are quickly understood -- you need to have a reason to take up all that visual real estate, especially when you are working with small screens.
            * Context is part of it -- top left tells us signal strength, probably less understandable in a different context
            * Top right tells us battery power
            * Imagine if these were both just percentages, maybe with "Signal" and "Battery Power" instead
            * Same information, but this is packaged in less space and less visually cluttered
            * Smaller screens are also probably part of why we are seeing so many of these

            * Web is interesting for its many screens
            * Variety in sizes, styles, this one has 48 for a single icon

            * You can always read text and try to puzzle out the exact meaning
            * But if you don't recognize an icon, what fallback do you have?

                * Icons can wind up adding visual noise rather than helpful signposts
                * Control panels seem to be a pretty good stress test
                * There are a couple things going wrong here
                * First, there's just too much going on.
                * Icons help identify key pieces of information. Everything here is important. So nothing is.
                * But you can also see that they tried to make all of the icons uniform
                * They are all gray squares with little sliders
                * Which makes them even more indistinguishable
                * The only thing these icons establish is a visual rhythm -- you're better off just reading the text
